# Loan-Eligibility-Prediction
This is a Machine Learning project to predict whether an applicant is elgibile for loan or not.
This project includes various Python libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib.
To predict whether an applicant is eligible or not, I have used Naive-Bayes Classifier algorithm based on features such as applicant's income, education, credit history, and more.
